## Project Overview

Data science analysis identifying literacy gaps across Abraham Accords nations (Israel, UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan) in support of UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education).## 📋 Project Overview

Data science analysis identifying literacy gaps across Abraham Accords nations (Israel, UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan) in support of UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education).

**Student Lead:** Vanessa Ngeno  
**Institution:** Yeshiva University - Master's in Data Analytics & Visualization  
**Partners:** Peblink, Abraham Accords Educational Alliance, World Literacy Foundation

## 🎯 Key Findings

- **Morocco's $311M Investment:** Increased literacy from 47.7% to 72.1% (+24.4 points) with $1.62/point efficiency
- **Sudan Crisis:** Literacy projected to decline by 2.9 points due to conflict (AALNI score: 115.7)
- **Investment Impact:** Investment accounts for only 1.6% of literacy improvement; systemic factors (secondary education, gender equity, learning quality) drive 88.9% of results

## 📊 Deliverables

1. **Abraham Accords Literacy Need Index (AALNI)** - Composite vulnerability scoring
2. **Interactive Heat Maps** - 3 GIS visualizations (HTML)
3. **Predictive Models** - DiD Panel Regression, Gamma GLM, Random Forest, Prophet forecasting
4. **2030 SDG Projections** - Only 3/5 countries will achieve 95% literacy target
5. **Policy Brief** - $950M investment allocation with $735.6M optimization opportunity
